## Docs:
You actually either:

Don't want to display that ugly back button ( :] ), and thus go for : `AppBar(...,automaticallyImplyLeading: false,...); `  

Don't want the user to go back - replacing current view - and thus go for: `Navigator.pushReplacementNamed(## your routename here ##);`

Don't want the user to go back - replacing a certain view back in the stack - and thus use: `Navigator.pushNamedAndRemoveUntil(## your routename here ##, f(Route<dynamic>)â†’bool);` where f is a function returning truewhen meeting the last view you want to keep in the stack (right before the new one);  

Don't want the user to go back - EVER - emptying completely the navigator stack with: `Navigator.pushNamedAndRemoveUntil(context, ## your routename here ##, (_) => false);`
